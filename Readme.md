# Concurrent Programming in Java

Concurrent programming involves creating applications that perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In Java, this is achieved using threads, which are managed by the operating system. Threads allow for multitasking, enabling various operations concurrently, like correcting text, saving files, or checking for new emails.

## Threads and Task Execution

- **Threads** manage tasks orchestrated by the Thread Scheduler, which balances tasks, handles waiting times (network or disk operations), and ensures synchronization.
- Java utilizes the `Runnable` interface and `Thread` class for task modeling and execution. Tasks are executed within threads, either using the main thread or creating new threads.

## Synchronization and Race Conditions

- **Synchronization** prevents race conditions where multiple threads try to access and modify shared variables simultaneously.
- Techniques like `synchronized` blocks or methods, along with `wait` and `notify` methods, help manage access to shared resources and avoid race conditions.

## Deadlocks and Solutions

- **Deadlocks** occur when threads hold resources and wait indefinitely for others to release resources they need.
- Strategies to prevent deadlocks include careful resource locking and avoiding exposure of synchronization objects.

## Producer-Consumer Problem

- The issue arises when multiple threads interact with a shared buffer. Proper synchronization via `wait` and `notify` helps manage this scenario effectively.

## CPU Multi-Core Considerations

- Handling visibility problems in multi-core CPUs involves understanding happens-before relationships. This relationship ensures consistency between threads through synchronization and volatile constructs.

## Best Practices

- Implementing concurrent programming requires understanding thread management, synchronization techniques, and avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.
