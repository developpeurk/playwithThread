# Concurrent Programming in Java

Concurrent programming involves creating applications that perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In Java, this is achieved using threads, which are managed by the operating system. Threads allow for multitasking, enabling various operations concurrently, like correcting text, saving files, or checking for new emails.

## Threads and Task Execution

- **Threads** manage tasks orchestrated by the Thread Scheduler, which balances tasks, handles waiting times (network or disk operations), and ensures synchronization.
- Java utilizes the `Runnable` interface and `Thread` class for task modeling and execution. Tasks are executed within threads, either using the main thread or creating new threads.

## Synchronization and Race Conditions

- **Synchronization** prevents race conditions where multiple threads try to access and modify shared variables simultaneously.
- Techniques like `synchronized` blocks or methods, along with `wait` and `notify` methods, help manage access to shared resources and avoid race conditions.

## Deadlocks and Solutions

- **Deadlocks** occur when threads hold resources and wait indefinitely for others to release resources they need.
- Strategies to prevent deadlocks include careful resource locking and avoiding exposure of synchronization objects.

## Producer-Consumer Problem

- The issue arises when multiple threads interact with a shared buffer. Proper synchronization via `wait` and `notify` helps manage this scenario effectively.

## CPU Multi-Core Considerations

- Handling visibility problems in multi-core CPUs involves understanding happens-before relationships. This relationship ensures consistency between threads through synchronization and volatile constructs.

## Best Practices

- Implementing concurrent programming requires understanding thread management, synchronization techniques, and avoiding race conditions and deadlocks.

## Concurrent Programming in Java - Advanced Topics

### Executors and ExecutorService

- Executors manage threads and allow controlled thread creation.
- ExecutorService provides an interface extending Executor with various execution strategies.
- `Executors` class provides factory methods like `.newSingleThreadExecutor()` and `.newFixedThreadPoolExecutor(4)`.
- ExecutorService allows submitting tasks, including `Runnable` and `Callable`.
- Executing tasks using `submit()` returns `Future` objects to manage task completion.
- The `Future` object facilitates blocking on task completion and handling exceptions.

### Thread States and Interruptions

- Thread states include NEW, BLOCKED, RUNNABLE, TIMED_WAITING, WAITING, and TERMINATE.
- Methods like `interrupt()` and `stop()` are used to handle thread interruptions, though `stop()` is deprecated.
- Threads in WAITING and TIMED_WAITING states will throw an `InterruptedException` when interrupted.

### Stopping an ExecutorService

- An ExecutorService can be stopped using `es.shutdown()` or `es.shutdownNow()`.
- `shutdown()` ensures submitted tasks finish execution.
- `shutdownNow()` attempts to stop all tasks in the queue and those currently running.

### Atomic Variables and Synchronization Primitives

- `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, and `AtomicReference` offer atomic operations on variables.
- `compareAndSet` (CAS) maintains memory consistency and ensures thread-safe operations.
- Synchronization primitives like locks, semaphores, barriers, and latches provide thread-safe coordination.

### Locks and Conditions

- Locks like `ReentrantLock` and conditions help synchronize code blocks.
- Conditions work similarly to `wait()` and `notify()` methods in handling thread coordination.

### CyclicBarrier and CountDownLatch

- `CyclicBarrier` enables synchronization among a fixed number of threads waiting for each other.
- `CountDownLatch` allows one or more threads to wait until a set number of operations are completed.

### Concurrent Collections

- Java provides thread-safe collections like `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, `BlockingQueue`, and `ConcurrentHashMap`.
- These collections ensure thread-safe operations and visibility guarantees in a multi-threaded context.

### Other Thread-Safe Data Structures

- `BlockingQueue` implementations like `ArrayBlockingQueue` and `LinkedBlockingQueue` provide different queuing strategies.
- `ConcurrentHashMap` and `ConcurrentSkipListMap` offer thread-safe map implementations.
